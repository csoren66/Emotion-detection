## Overview
The task is to categorize each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression into one of seven categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral).


## Methodology
1. Load the FER2013 dataset
2. Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets
3. Preprocess the data (e.g., resizing the images, converting to grayscale, normalization)
4. Define the architecture of the neural network (e.g., convolutional neural network)
5. Train the model on the training set
6. Evaluate the model on the validation set
7. Test the model on the testing set


## Dataset & Description


The data consists of **48x48 pixel grayscale images** of faces. The faces have been automatically registered so that the face is more or less centred and occupies about the same amount of space in each image.
The training set consists of 28,709 examples and the public test set consists of 3,589 examples.
